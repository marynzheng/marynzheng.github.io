	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>I'm a student, living in Berkeley, CA. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development after playing Neopets in elementary school. When I saw custom user page themes, I realized that customization is endless and the websites are an ever-malleable creative medium! This turned into a hobby of making MySpace layouts in middle school; but ever since the era of standardized Facebook layouts, my interest in website has mainly been limited to building my own portfolio website. Before signing up for General Assembly's Web Design Circuit, I realized that while I know how to take photos and make graphics and write content for websites, I don't actually know how to make the websites themselves. But this changes now! </p>

	<strong>My Mission</strong>

	<p>As I learn more about front-end, I hope to one day work as a Senior Multimedia Marketing Manager with Taulia because I like to work in a fun but also LET'S-DO-THIS! type of startup environment.</p>
