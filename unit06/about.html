<section>
	<p>Mary is a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>

	<p>She studies Political Economy with a concentration in Chinese Economy and Society; but true to her interdisciplinary college major, Mary also has a heart for photo-/videography, art and design, old literature, the French language, hiking, music making, and birds.</p>

	<p>On any given day, Mary can usually be found helping out with her church in Berkeley, creating graphics as a part of Taulia's marketing team in San Francisco, happily slurping avocado smoothies, or reading books (but actually taking naps) on Memorial Glade.</p>

	<p>After she graduates in May 2015, Mary hopes to work in graphic design, web development, or UI/UX design.</p>
