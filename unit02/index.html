	<title>Website Inspiration</title>

		<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
		<p>Although there are many websites that catch my eye, the two that most inspired me are as follows:</p>
		<p><a href="http://squarespace.com/seven/">Squarespace 7</a>
		<br><a href="http://cedricdiradourian.com/#">Cedric Diradourian's Portfolio</a></p>
		<hr>
		<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
		<h3>Squarespace 7:</h3>
		<em>Space</em>
		<ul>
			<li>Positive space covers entire screen, but there is also positive and negative space within the content block</li>
			<li>This makes the website clean and easily readable, but also piques your interest as to what is going on in the background</li>
		</ul>
		<em>Size</em>
		<ul>
			<li>Full-size layout that utilizes white to draw focus to the text</li>
		</ul>
		<em>Balance</em>
		<ul>
			<li>I like that the 7 is centered, drawing focus to the fact that it is a new, upgraded version</li>
		</ul></p>
		<br>
		<p><h3>Cedric Diradourian's Portfolio:</h3>
		<em>Space</em>
		<ul>
			<li>Big pictures cover the entire space of the website</li>
			<li>Single focal point</li>
		</ul>
		<em>Size</em>
		<ul>
			<li>Full-size images no matter what resolution you are viewing the website at.</li>
			<li>I also like the padding around the images a lot, it keeps the full-size images from appearing too oppressive</li>
		</ul>
		<em>Balance</em>
		<ul>
			<li>Because it is just one big image displayed at a time, and centered, the website is visually pleasing and clean</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<hr>
		<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
		<h3>Similarities:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Both implement heavy use of black and white</li>
			<li>Clean visual aesthetic</li>
			<li>Big pictures</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Differences:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The Squarespace website is more interesting, switching layouts and focal points</li>
			<li>Cedric Diradourian's website is almost completely visually driven (but this makes sense, because it is a portfolio)</li>
			<li>Squarespace's website aims to sell a product and operates like a demo that you walk through, with various pages showcasing different features</li>
			<li>Cedric Diradourian's website is a portfolio, so instead of trying to sell a product, it instead allows you to get lost in the magic of the images rather than explainin what is going on</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Portfolio Website - Thumbnail Sketches</h2>
		<ul>
		<img src="http://marynzheng.github.io/unit02/thumbnail-u02.jpg" width="1000">
		<p><strong>Home</strong></p>
		<p>For my home page, I would like to have little text and a full-size image rotation, to help draw immediate attention to my work. However, I have two possibilities, based on what my long-term goals are for this portfolio:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>If I want to keep it focused on my photography, I will defer to the first "Home" thumbnail, on the top-left of the image. This version has a logo on the top left, and a small navigation bar to the top right, but the focus is strictly on the images, as there is no over the images.
			<p>Here, the balance is determined by the background image, and it takes precedent, establishing hierarchy. The brand comes second, with the logo being the second-largest element on the page, followed by the navigation bar.</p></li>
			<li>If I want to begin to establish myself as not just someone who takes pictures, but also as someone who dabbles in other medias, as my portfolio has started to show, then it might be better to put the focus on branding.
			<p>In this case, I would move my logo and the navigation bar to the center of the screen, and have a slider of full-size images in the background, but nothing too fancy as to distract from the logo and nav bar. The logo thus determines the balance of the page, which will be fairly symmetrical and centered, and establishes hierarchy through its prominent position.</p></li>
		</ol>
		<p><strong>Portfolio</strong></p>
		<p>For the portfolio section of my website, I imagine that for each kind of media or category (different photo sets, for example), there would be a string of images that viewers could scroll through, and when you clicked on the image, the website will display a full-size version of the image.</p>
		<p>To navigate to this string of images, I could either depend on a drop-down list through the navigation bar (implied through the first "Port" thumbnail images), or have a mini-landing page with thumbnails leading to separate pages with their respective string of images.</p>
		<p>Here, balance will be achieved using fewer rows and columns and enough negative space as to not let viewers feel overwhelmed by the amount of images. Hierarchy is determined by the central location of the string of images, which will catch immediate attention and also operate as the focal point.
		<p><strong>About</strong></p>
		<p>The About page will be fairly standard, with a medium-sized image and some text that follows. Based on whether I choose to go the photography-only route or the branding route, I will switch the balance of the layout to either leave the logo and navigation bar in their unobtrusive positions at the top left and top right, respectively, or move it to the top center, to command attention and act as the focal point and most important element of the page.</p>
		<p><strong>Blog</strong></p>
		<p>For the blog, I imagine one of the following:
		<ol>
			<li>A standard one-column layout with several blog posts on each page, each distinguished by bolded title and date headers, leaving everything else simple and straightforward</li>
			<li>A more creative blog layout, with the central logo branding; but instead of jumping right into content, a row of vertical thumbnail images with titles on top. This would be a more image-focused layout, more catchy, rather than relying on viewers to read what I have to say because I am a good writer (haha).
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p>On the blog, balance will be achieved through the use of either the single-column vertical or horizontal layout. As of now, I think I would not want to establish a strong sense of hierarchy on the page, as I don't imagine one piece of content being more important than the other; but if I do go with the horizontal thumbnail-based layout, I hope to create multiple focal points with the thumbnail images, rather than a lack of focal points, which I would try to establish in the vertical single-column layout.
		</ul>
